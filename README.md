# SCUM-Trader-Tool
With that SCUM Tool you can add new Items easily to the Traders (Economyoverride.json). This Program starts in German Language. If you are a international Player, you can change the Language with a click on "Deutsch" to "English".
# Installation
Not needed. You just only need to download the SCUM Trader Tool. Once the download is complete, you must unpack the ZIP Archive (WinRar or other).
# Instruction
Fill in all the fields (you need the Asset Name of the Item), select "Can be purchased" and click on "Create". Clicking Copy (Result) copies the Code to the Clipboard. If an Item is to be added to existing Code, a Comma can be appended to it with "Item will be added".

**Please read the Readme Textdocument (it's in the ZIP Archive) before you use our Tool!**
