**Please read the Readme Textdocument (it's in the ZIP Archive) before you use our Tool!**

# Instruction
Fill in all the fields (you need the Asset Name of the Item), select "Can be purchased" and click on "Create". Clicking Copy (Result) copies the Code to the Clipboard. If an Item is to be added to existing Code, a Comma can be appended to it with "Item will be added".

# Future Updates / Plans
What are the Plans for future Updates? At the moment: I can't tell you anything about that. I'm waiting for your feedback and already have a few ideas for new Updates. More hopefully soon.
